	     <h1>A Summer Day</h1>
	     <p><i>by Lucy Maud Montgomery</i></p>
	     <p>I<br>
			<br>
      	  The dawn laughs out on orient hills<br>
      	  And dances with the diamond rills;<br>
      	  The ambrosial wind but faintly stirs<br>
      	  The silken, beaded gossamers;<br>
      	  In the wide valleys, lone and fair,<br>
      	  Lyrics are piped from limpid air,<br>
      	  And, far above, the pine trees free<br>
      	  Voice ancient lore of sky and sea.<br>
      	  Come, let us fill our hearts straightway<br>
      	  With hope and courage of the day.<br>
			<br>
			<br>
      	  II<br>
			<br>
      	  Noon, hiving sweets of sun and flower,<br>
      	  Has fallen on dreams in wayside bower,<br>
      	  Where bees hold honeyed fellowship<br>
      	  With the ripe blossom of her lip;<br>
      	  All silent are her poppied vales<br>
      	  And all her long Arcadian dales,<br>
      	  Where idleness is gathered up<br>
      	  A magic draught in summer's cup.<br>
      	  Come, let us give ourselves to dreams<br>
      	  By lisping margins of her streams.<br>
			<br>
			<br>
      	  III<br>
			<br>
      	  Adown the golden sunset way<br>
      	  The evening comes in wimple gray;<br>
      	  By burnished shore and silver lake<br>
      	  Cool winds of ministration wake;<br>
      	  O'er occidental meadows far<br>
      	  There shines the light of moon and star,<br>
      	  And sweet, low-tinkling music rings<br>
      	  About the lips of haunted springs.<br>
      	  In quietude of earth and air<br>
      	  'Tis meet we yield our souls to prayer. </p>
